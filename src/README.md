# Time-Code Manager Project

This dev is barely started but it already taught precious things amidst wich...

- install a ```zip``` instead of a ```oxt```, it eases manipulation.

- Discover of the **Addon.xcu** pitfall. In image section, write ```<prop oor:name="URL">``` 
instead of ```<prop oor:name="URL" oor:type="xs:string">```. It will spare you time!

- See how you can start, test your macro straight away from code without installing
 the extension, in ```if __name__ == "__main__":``` of main python file.
 
## Ideas for future dev

- remove and install new extension in one command ```compile & install```

- implement a dialog box
